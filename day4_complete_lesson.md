### **Presentation Guidelines & Demo (0:12-0:18)**

**[Display Slide 2: Presentation Guidelines]**

**Teacher:** "Great tech presentations tell a story. Here's your formula for success:"

**🎯 PRESENTATION STRUCTURE (2-3 minutes each):**

1. **The Hook** (30 seconds)
   - "I analyzed articles about [your topic] and discovered something surprising..."
   - Show your most interesting finding first!

2. **The Demo** (90 seconds)
   - Run your interactive tool live
   - Show the visualization charts
   - Highlight what entities were found

3. **The Insight** (60 seconds)
   - What pattern surprised you most?
   - What did the computer catch that you missed?
   - How could this be useful in real life?

**Teacher Demo:**
**Teacher:** "Let me show you what this looks like. I analyzed three articles about climate change and discovered something fascinating..."

**[Teacher does a quick 2-minute demo using their own prepared example]**

**Example Teacher Demo:**
```
"I was curious about how different news sources cover climate change, so I 
analyzed articles from three different publications. My NER system found 
that one article mentioned 15 different countries, while another focused 
mainly on 3 specific companies. The visualization showed me that 'China' 
and 'United States' appeared in all three articles, but 'renewable energy' 
was only mentioned as an organization in one source. This tells me that 
different publications focus on different aspects of the same story!"
```

**Teacher:** "See how I started with curiosity, showed the tool working, and ended with a real insight? That's exactly what you'll do!"

---

### **Student Presentations - Round 1 (0:18-0:33)**

**Teacher:** "Time for the main event! Remember, we're celebrating each other's discoveries. I want to hear 'oohs' and 'ahhs' when someone shows something cool!"

**Presentation Order Strategy:**
- Start with confident students to set the tone
- Mix different article topics for variety
- Save the most impressive projects for the end

**[Each student gets 2.5 minutes + 30 seconds for transition]**

**Teacher's Role During Presentations:**
- Keep time and give gentle signals
- Ask follow-up questions to highlight cool discoveries
- Connect findings to real-world applications
- Celebrate unexpected insights

**Sample Teacher Follow-up Questions:**
- "That's fascinating! Why do you think [entity] appeared so often?"
- "How might a news editor use this information?"
- "What other topics would you like to analyze?"
- "Did anything surprise you about what the computer found?"

**Expected Student Presentation Topics:**
- Sports articles showing player mentions and team locations
- Entertainment articles tracking celebrity names and movie studios
- Technology articles revealing company partnerships and locations
- Political articles showing which officials are mentioned together

---

### **Student Presentations - Round 2 (0:33-0:43)**

**[Continue with remaining students]**

**Teacher:** "I'm hearing some incredible insights! You're thinking like real data scientists - finding patterns that humans might miss and asking the right follow-up questions."

**Mid-Presentation Observations:**
**Teacher:** "As we listen to these presentations, I want you to notice:"
- "Which entity types appear most often across all projects?"
- "Are there any common patterns everyone's discovering?"
- "What different insights come from different types of articles?"

**Connecting Presentations:**
**Teacher:** "Sarah found that sports articles mention cities a lot, while Jake's tech articles mentioned companies more. That's exactly the kind of domain-specific insight that makes NLP so powerful in different industries!"

### **Extension Challenges & Advanced Features (0:43-0:47)**

**[Display Slide 4: Extension Challenges]**

**Teacher:** "For those of you thinking 'This is cool, but what's next?' - here are some advanced challenges that take your NER skills to the next level!"

**🚀 EXTENSION CHALLENGES:**

**Level 1: Data Export**
```python
# Save results to CSV for Excel analysis
import csv

def save_to_csv(organized_entities, filename):
    with open(f"{filename}_entities.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        writer.writerow(["Entity", "Type", "Count"])
        for entity_type, entities in organized_entities.items():
            for entity, count in entities.items():
                writer.writerow([entity, entity_type, count])
```

**Level 2: Sentiment Analysis Integration**
```python
# Add positive/negative sentiment to entity mentions
from textblob import TextBlob

def analyze_entity_sentiment(text, entity):
    sentences = text.split('.')
    entity_sentences = [s for s in sentences if entity in s]
    
    sentiments = []
    for sentence in entity_sentences:
        blob = TextBlob(sentence)
        sentiments.append(blob.sentiment.polarity)
    
    avg_sentiment = sum(sentiments) / len(sentiments) if sentiments else 0
    return "Positive" if avg_sentiment > 0.1 else "Negative" if avg_sentiment < -0.1 else "Neutral"
```

**Level 3: Web Scraping Integration**
```python
# Automatically fetch news articles from websites
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_news_article(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Extract article text (this varies by website)
    paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
    article_text = ' '.join([p.get_text() for p in paragraphs])
    return article_text
```

**Level 4: Custom Entity Training**
```python
# Train spaCy to recognize custom entities (like your school's teams)
import spacy
from spacy.training import Example

# This is advanced - perfect for summer projects!
def train_custom_entities():
    # Train spaCy to recognize your local entities like school names,
    # local businesses, regional terms, etc.
    pass
```

**Teacher:** "These challenges could become great summer projects, science fair entries, or even college application portfolio pieces!"
